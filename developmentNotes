- goal is to build this from the command line and unerstand all of it
- it can be simple, but I want it to work and be reproducable
- I want to learn maven.
- ok, so I got maven to build the stringsMatrix demo I made last week, works pretty snappy from the command line.
- now, I want to use it to build a web app.... need to add a web ui html in a war file to the project... how to do that?
- actually, before I do that... Id like to add a unit test to the string sorter function... just to try it, and make it fail and then pass... just to get than hang of it.

10/6/13 Sunday 2:53
- ok, I got the unit tests to work... pretty cool. It actually found a bug in my string sorter thingy that I didnt know about before... I was truncating one character on the sorted version of the string... my unit test found that bug!!! pretty darn COOOOLIO!!! I am a believer in TTD and automated unit testing!!!
- I also added log4j to the project... this works when run in maven, but is failing when I attempt to run the main() from the created jar file cause that
jar file doesnt have in it any of the lib jars for log4j... how to get those libs into my applications JAR???? can maven do that for me somehow?  It did put
in my log4j.properties resources into the jar by me just placing the properties file in my projects main/src/resources directory... is there something
like that for jars I want to be in package and hence wind up on the execuatbles class path?
- ok, it turns out the maven way of doing things is to orient around a goal of making an artificat. That artificat may have dependencys on other artrigacts
for runtime use, but doesnt recomend putting those dependencies into the same artificat.  Instead each artifact should know what it requires and the runtime
tool should ensure that  those dependencies are available, not the individual artifact.  So in the case of my litter string  reversing package I used log4j, but the log4j lib jar file wouldnt be made part of the stringreverse jar file I created, instead the dependency would be noted and dealth with by the runtime
tool, in this case it would be the tool that builds the WAR file... it would know to deploy all this stuff from my string reverser to log4j to whateer...
- Also I think Jenkins might be the tool tha handles runtime dependency and classpath setup.

- so, good news last night I was able to get maven to build a web app that had two artifacts, jar and a war that contained that war, and i even got it to deploy to the jetty servlet container... pretty cool. all from the command line.

- today I want to add the containing pom that will cause both the other two artifacts to be built
- then I want to get get to work10/9/13 Wednesday 10:31
